                <h2>Java String Based Game</h2>
                <p>This is a game we are deveping in java to see what we can do while only being able to display anything to the screen using strings. Currently all we have done is get a movement system in place and some basic icons but one day we hope to make a fully functioning game.</p>

                <h2>Python 2-d Platformer</h2>
                <p>This game was initially developed as a way for one of us to learn python but over time is has slowly become a more functional 2-d platformer which we hope one day will turn into a great game. This was also the first project that was started for quadrilateral development that was not written using Visual Basic.</p>
